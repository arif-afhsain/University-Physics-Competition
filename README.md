# University Physics Competition (UPC) — Team Repository

This repository contains our team’s work for the **University Physics Competition** (https://www.uphysicsc.com/ ) for 2023 and 2024.  We won a **Silver** medal in 2023 and a **Gold** medal in 2024. It was the second gold for our country (the first was in 2019, Team 289: https://www.uphysicsc.com/2019contest.html )

- 2024 problems and results: https://www.uphysicsc.com/2024contest.html

## About the competition
UPC is an international, 48-hour team contest for undergraduate students. Teams tackle two open-ended physics problems, develop models and simulations, and submit a written report. Entries are judged on physical insight, modeling, computation, and clarity of presentation.

## Tips for future participants
- UPC usually occurs in the **first week of November**; results are often published in mid-January.  
- Registration fee: **$45** (one-time, via faculty sponsor). If the fee poses a hardship, contact the organizers: [director@uphysicsc.com]{mailto:director@uphysicsc.com}.
- Focus on simple, well-explained models and clean writing — clarity often beats complexity under the time constraint.

## Message from me
UPC is a rollercoaster ride. We had a load of fun during the competition and a bucket full of memories. The pressure feels overwhelming at first, but quite enjoyable as time passes. I wish all the future endeavors all the best. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me at [arif.afhsain@gmail.com](mailto:arif.afhsain@gmail.com).
