This repository contains our team's work for the University Physics Competition (\href{https://www.uphysicsc.com/}{https://www.uphysicsc.com/}), for the years 2023 and 2024. Our team achieved a silver medal in 2023 and a gold medal in 2024. You can check the problems and results here: [https://www.uphysicsc.com/2024contest.html]{https://www.uphysicsc.com/2024contest.html}

# About the competition
UPC is an international contest where undergraduate students work in teams to solve real-world physics problems within 48 hours then submit their solution copies. UPC challenges participants from various countries to apply physics principles, mathematical modeling, and computational techniques to develop creative solutions to open-ended physical scenarios. Teams write a formal report describing their approach, derivations, and results, which are evaluated for clarity, physics insight, and presentation.

The following are the details of our team for UPC:
Institution: University of Dhaka, Bangladesh.
